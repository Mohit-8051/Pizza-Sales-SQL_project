In this project, I, Mohit Kumar, undertook a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data
using SQL. The objective was to derive valuable insights from the data, ranging from
basic metrics like total orders and revenue to advanced analyses of sales patterns and
revenue contributions. This project aimed to provide a deep understanding of customer
preferences, sales performance, and key revenue drivers in the pizza industry.The
analysis was structured into three levels:
Basic Analysis: Focused on fundamental metrics such as total orders, revenue, and
popular pizza types.
Intermediate Analysis: Delved into more detailed aspects like category-wise
distribution and time-based ordering patterns.
Advanced Analysis: Included complex insights like revenue contribution percentages
and cumulative sales trends
This project was an
enriching experience, allowing me to apply and
enhance my SQL skills while uncovering valuable
insights from real-world data.
